# speedtest-lua
a lua script for speedtest

Considering lua doesn't support thread and coroutine is not a good parallel method for multiple upload/download testing, the testing result will not be accurate, use a new project(lua+c) instead. The new project is @ https://github.com/egliu/https://github.com/egliu/SpeedTestCWithLuaInterface .
